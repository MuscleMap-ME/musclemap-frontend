## What is MuscleMap?

MuscleMap is a fitness app that helps you train smarter by:

- **Visualizing** which muscles you're working during each exercise
- **Generating** personalized workouts based on your goals and equipment
- **Tracking** your progress with our unique Training Units (TU) system
- **Balancing** your training to prevent muscle imbalances
- **Connecting** you with a community of like-minded athletes

Whether you train at home with just your bodyweight, swing kettlebells in your garage, or hit the gym with a full rack of weights - MuscleMap adapts to you.

Don't worry - you can change your archetype later as your goals evolve.

## Workouts

### How Workout Generation Works

When you tap "Start Workout," MuscleMap's prescription engine creates a personalized routine by considering:

1. **Your archetype** - Exercises aligned with your goals
2. **Your level** - Appropriate difficulty progression
3. **Your equipment** - Only exercises you can perform
4. **Your location** - Gym, home, park, hotel, or office
5. **Recent workouts** - Avoids overworking tired muscles
6. **Time available** - Fits your schedule

The result? A balanced workout that hits the right muscles at the right intensity.

### During Your Workout

For each exercise, you'll see:

- **Exercise name and demo**
- **Target sets and reps**
- **Muscles activated** (with intensity percentages)
- **Rest timer**

Log your actual performance:
- Reps completed
- Weight used (if applicable)
- RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) - how hard it felt (1-10)
- Notes for yourself

### After Your Workout

When you finish, you'll see:

- **Total Training Units earned**
- **Muscle activation heatmap**
- **Time and volume stats**
- **Credits spent**

Your workout is saved to your history and contributes to your level progression.

---

## Training Units (TU)

Training Units are MuscleMap's proprietary metric for measuring workout volume. Unlike simple rep counting, TU accounts for:

- **Muscle size** - Working your glutes earns more than working your forearms
- **Activation intensity** - Primary muscles count more than stabilizers
- **Exercise difficulty** - Harder movements earn proportionally more

This means:
- A full-body workout and an arm day can be fairly compared
- Your cumulative TU represents real, balanced training volume
- Level progression reflects genuine progress, not just showing up

---

## Progression System

### Levels

Each archetype has 10+ themed levels. For example:

**Bodybuilder Levels:**
1. Newcomer
2. Gym Rat
3. Pump Chaser
4. Iron Disciple
5. Mass Builder
6. Symmetry Seeker
7. Stage Ready
8. Classic Physique

## Tips for Success

### Start Where You Are
Choose exercises and weights that challenge you but allow good form. MuscleMap adjusts to your level over time.

### Be Consistent
Regular training beats occasional intense sessions. Your streak counter and weekly insights help you stay accountable.

### Trust the System
The prescription engine considers your recovery. If certain muscles aren't in your workout, it's because they need rest.

### Log Honestly
Accurate logging helps MuscleMap give you better recommendations. Don't inflate your numbers - the only person you're cheating is yourself.

### Explore the Library
Try new exercises! The library has movements you might not have considered that could become new favorites.

### Engage the Community
High fives, competitions, and messaging make training more fun. Fitness is better with friends.
