# Training Units (TU)

> The fairest way to measure workout volume.

---

## Overview

Training Units (TU) is MuscleMap's proprietary metric for measuring workout effectiveness. Unlike simple rep counting, TU accounts for muscle size, activation intensity, and exercise difficulty.

---

## The Problem with Rep Counting

Traditional fitness apps count reps:

```
TRADITIONAL COUNTING (Unfair)
=============================

Workout A: 100 bicep curls = 100 reps
Workout B: 100 squats      = 100 reps

Same score!

But squats work:
- Quadriceps (large muscle)
- Glutes (large muscle)
- Hamstrings (medium muscle)
- Core (medium muscle)

While bicep curls work:
- Biceps (small muscle)

These workouts are NOT equal!
```

---

## How TU Works

### The Formula

```
TU = Sum of (muscle_volume × activation% × difficulty)

For each muscle engaged:
- muscle_volume: Relative size (0.2 to 1.0)
- activation%: How hard it works (0% to 100%)
- difficulty: Exercise complexity (1.0 to 1.5)
```

### Muscle Volume Factors

Larger muscles contribute more to TU:

| Muscle Group | Relative Volume | TU Multiplier |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Quadriceps | Large | 1.00 |
| Glutes | Large | 0.90 |
| Lats | Large | 0.80 |
| Hamstrings | Medium-Large | 0.70 |
| Chest | Medium | 0.60 |
| Shoulders | Medium | 0.50 |
| Core | Medium | 0.40 |
| Triceps | Small-Medium | 0.35 |
| Biceps | Small | 0.30 |
| Calves | Small | 0.25 |
| Forearms | Small | 0.20 |

### Activation Percentages

How hard a muscle works in each exercise:

```
BENCH PRESS EXAMPLE
===================

Muscle         Activation    Volume    Contribution
------         ----------    ------    ------------
Chest          85%           0.60      0.51 TU/rep
Triceps        65%           0.35      0.23 TU/rep
Front Delts    45%           0.25      0.11 TU/rep
Core           20%           0.40      0.08 TU/rep
                                       ----------
Total per rep:                         0.93 TU
```

### Difficulty Multiplier

Complex exercises earn bonus TU:

| Difficulty | Multiplier | Examples |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Basic | 1.0x | Machine exercises, simple isolation |
| Standard | 1.1x | Most free weight exercises |
| Compound | 1.2x | Squats, deadlifts, bench press |
| Complex | 1.3x | Olympic lifts, advanced movements |
| Skill-based | 1.5x | Muscle-ups, pistol squats |

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Squat (3 sets × 10 reps)

```
SQUAT TU CALCULATION
====================

Per rep:
  Quadriceps:  95% × 1.0 = 0.95
  Glutes:      85% × 0.9 = 0.77
  Hamstrings:  65% × 0.7 = 0.46
  Core:        40% × 0.4 = 0.16
  Calves:      30% × 0.25 = 0.08
  Erectors:    55% × 0.3 = 0.17
  ----------------------------
  Subtotal:                2.59 TU

Difficulty (compound): × 1.2
Per rep total: 3.11 TU

Full workout:
3 sets × 10 reps × 3.11 = 93.3 TU
```

### Example 2: Bicep Curl (3 sets × 12 reps)

```
BICEP CURL TU CALCULATION
=========================

Per rep:
  Biceps:      90% × 0.3 = 0.27
  Forearms:    40% × 0.2 = 0.08
  ----------------------------
  Subtotal:                0.35 TU

Difficulty (basic): × 1.0
Per rep total: 0.35 TU

Full workout:
3 sets × 12 reps × 0.35 = 12.6 TU
```

### Comparison

```
FAIR COMPARISON
===============

Squats (3×10):     93.3 TU  ████████████████████
Bicep Curls (3×12): 12.6 TU  ███

Squats earn 7.4× more TU because they work
more muscle mass with more complexity.

This is fair - squats ARE harder!
```

## TU Benefits

### Fair Competition

```
LEADERBOARD COMPARISON
======================

Without TU:
  @ArmDay_Andy:     500 reps (all curls)
  @LegDay_Larry:    300 reps (all squats)
  Winner: Andy (but Larry trained harder!)

With TU:
  @ArmDay_Andy:     175 TU (all curls)
  @LegDay_Larry:    558 TU (all squats)
  Winner: Larry (fair!)
```

### Muscle Balance

TU naturally encourages balanced training:

```
BALANCE INCENTIVE
=================

To maximize TU, you should:
✓ Train large muscles (legs, back, chest)
✓ Use compound exercises
✓ Hit all muscle groups

Gaming the system requires:
✗ Endless isolation work
✗ Much more time for same TU
```

### Progress Tracking

TU provides meaningful progress metrics:

```
PROGRESS OVER TIME
==================

Month 1: 450 TU (establishing baseline)
Month 2: 520 TU (+15% improvement)
Month 3: 580 TU (+12% improvement)
Month 4: 610 TU (+5% - plateau?)
Month 5: 680 TU (+12% - breakthrough!)

TU shows REAL progress, not just showing up.
```

## FAQ

### Q: Does weight lifted affect TU?

**A:** Currently, TU measures volume (sets × reps × muscles). Weight/intensity is tracked separately via RPE. Future versions may incorporate load.

### Q: Why doesn't cardio earn more TU?

**A:** TU is designed for resistance training volume. Cardio has different metrics (duration, heart rate) better suited to endurance activities.

### Q: Can I game TU with isolation exercises?

**A:** You could, but it's inefficient. Compound movements earn much more TU per minute. Gaming requires significantly more time.

### Q: How is activation data determined?

**A:** Activation percentages come from:
- EMG (electromyography) research
- Peer-reviewed exercise science
- Biomechanical analysis
- Expert consultation

### Q: Why do similar exercises have different TU?

**A:** Variations affect muscle activation. A wide-grip bench hits more chest than close-grip (more triceps). Our database captures these differences.

### Q: Does rest time affect TU?

**A:** No. TU measures work done, not workout duration. Short rests don't earn more TU - they just complete the workout faster.

## Technical Details

For developers and data enthusiasts:

### TU Formula (Precise)

```
TU_set = Σ (volume[m] × activation[m][e] × difficulty[e]) × reps

Where:
- m = each muscle
- e = exercise
- volume[m] = muscle size factor (0.2-1.0)
- activation[m][e] = muscle activation for exercise (0-1)
- difficulty[e] = exercise complexity (1.0-1.5)
- reps = repetitions completed
```

### Data Sources

- NSCA Exercise Database
- ACE Exercise Library
- Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research
- Custom EMG validation studies
