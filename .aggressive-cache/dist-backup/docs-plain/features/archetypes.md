## What Are Archetypes?

Archetypes are training philosophies that define your fitness identity in MuscleMap. Each archetype represents a distinct approach to training with its own:

- **Progression system** with unique level names
- **Stat distributions** that affect your character build
- **Specialized achievements** and milestones
- **Community** of like-minded trainers
