## Getting Started

### Q: Is MuscleMap free?

**A:** MuscleMap is free to download and use. You get 100 free credits when you sign up (enough for 4 workouts). Additional credits can be purchased, or you can subscribe for unlimited workouts.

### Q: What platforms is MuscleMap available on?

**A:**
- Web: Any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- iOS: iPhone and iPad
- Android: Phones and tablets
- Apple Watch: Companion app for workout tracking

### Q: Can I change my archetype later?

**A:** Yes! Go to Settings → Profile → Archetype. Changing your archetype:
- Resets your level to 1
- Keeps all your TU history
- Keeps all your achievements
- Keeps your workout history

### Q: What equipment do I need?

**A:** None! MuscleMap works with bodyweight-only training. However, having access to equipment unlocks more exercise variety. Tell MuscleMap what you have, and it will only suggest exercises you can do.

## Workouts

### Q: How many credits do workouts cost?

**A:** Each generated workout costs 25 credits. You start with 100 credits (4 free workouts).

### Q: Can I do my own exercises instead of the suggested ones?

**A:** Yes! During a workout, you can:
- **Skip** any exercise
- **Swap** for an alternative
- **Add** exercises manually
- Log any exercise from the library

### Q: What if I can't complete all the suggested sets?

**A:** That's fine! Log what you actually do. MuscleMap learns from your performance and adjusts future recommendations. Partial workouts still earn TU.

### Q: How does the workout generator decide what exercises to give me?

**A:** The prescription engine considers:
- Your archetype and level
- Your available equipment
- Your recent workout history (recovery)
- Your location (gym, home, etc.)
- Your available time
- Muscle balance needs

### Q: Can I repeat the same workout?

**A:** Yes! After completing a workout, you can save it as a template. You can also view your history and repeat any past workout.

### Q: What's the difference between RPE and RIR?

**A:**
- **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)**: How hard the set felt (1-10 scale)
- **RIR (Reps In Reserve)**: How many more reps you could have done

They're inversely related: RPE 10 = RIR 0 (no reps left)

## Progress & Stats

### Q: What are Training Units (TU)?

**A:** TU is MuscleMap's proprietary metric for measuring workout volume. Unlike simple rep counting, TU accounts for:
- Muscle size (larger muscles = more TU)
- Activation intensity
- Exercise difficulty

This makes comparing different workouts fair. A leg day and an arm day both earn proportional credit.

### Q: How is my level calculated?

**A:** Your level is based on cumulative TU earned. Each level requires more TU than the last. Different archetypes have different level names but similar TU requirements.

### Q: How does MuscleMap calculate my 1RM?

**A:** MuscleMap uses the Epley formula:

```
1RM = weight × (1 + reps/30)
```

For example: 80kg × 8 reps = 80 × 1.27 = 101kg estimated 1RM

### Q: My stats seem wrong. What should I do?

**A:** Go to Settings → Advanced → Recalculate Stats. This rebuilds your stats from your workout history. If issues persist, contact support.

### Q: Can I manually edit my workout history?

**A:** You can:
- Delete workouts you logged by mistake
- Edit set details within 24 hours
- Add notes to past workouts

You cannot add fake historical workouts.
