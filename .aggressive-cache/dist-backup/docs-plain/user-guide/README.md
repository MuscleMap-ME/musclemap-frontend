## Key Concepts

### Training Units (TU)

MuscleMap's proprietary volume metric. Unlike simple rep counting, TU accounts for:
- Muscle size (larger muscles = more TU)
- Activation intensity (primary vs secondary muscles)
- Exercise difficulty

**Why it matters**: TU lets you fairly compare different workouts. A leg day and an arm day both earn proportional credit.

[Learn more about TU](../concepts/training-units.md)

### Archetypes

Your training philosophy. Each archetype has unique:
- Level names and progression
- Exercise recommendations
- Achievement tracks
- Community features

[Full archetype guide](../features/archetypes.md)

### Credits

MuscleMap's currency system:
- Start with 100 credits
- Workouts cost 25 credits
- Purchase more or earn through achievements
- Unlock premium features

## Tips for Success

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    SUCCESS TIPS                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                   |
|  1. BE CONSISTENT                                                 |
|     Regular training beats occasional intense sessions.           |
|     Your streak counter helps you stay accountable.               |
|                                                                   |
|  2. LOG HONESTLY                                                  |
|     Accurate data = better recommendations.                       |
|     Only you see your detailed stats.                             |
|                                                                   |
|  3. TRUST THE SYSTEM                                              |
|     The prescription engine considers your recovery.              |
|     If muscles aren't in your workout, they need rest.            |
|                                                                   |
|  4. EXPLORE THE LIBRARY                                           |
|     Try new exercises! You might find new favorites.              |
|                                                                   |
|  5. ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY                                          |
|     High fives, competitions, and crews make training fun.        |
|                                                                   |
