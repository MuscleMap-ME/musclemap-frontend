## Quick Summaries

### Training Units (TU)

MuscleMap's proprietary volume metric that accounts for:
- Muscle size (larger muscles = more TU)
- Activation intensity (how hard the muscle works)
- Exercise difficulty (compound movements earn more)

**Key insight**: A leg day and arm day earn proportional TU based on actual muscle work, not just rep count.

### Muscle Activation

Every exercise activates multiple muscles at different intensities:

```
BENCH PRESS ACTIVATION
======================
Chest:         85% (Primary)
Triceps:       65% (Secondary)
Front Delts:   45% (Secondary)
Core:          20% (Stabilizer)
```

MuscleMap tracks this for 800+ exercises across 40+ muscle groups.

### Credits Economy

Credits are MuscleMap's currency:

| Action | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| Sign up bonus | +100 |
| Generate workout | -25 |
| Purchase pack | +varies |
| Achievements | +varies |

### Progression System

Level up through your archetype by earning TU:

```
Level 1 → Level 2:    100 TU
Level 2 → Level 3:    200 TU
Level 3 → Level 4:    300 TU
...
Level 9 → Level 10:   1,500 TU
```

Each archetype has unique level names reflecting its philosophy.
