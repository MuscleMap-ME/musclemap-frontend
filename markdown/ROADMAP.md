# MuscleMap Product Roadmap

## Core Philosophy
- **Visual-first**: Immersive 3D experiences, not spreadsheets

- **Body-positive**: Inclusive for all abilities and body types
- **Real-time**: Geo-located, data-rich, always current
- **Rewarding**: Early and continuous rewards for progress

## User Experience Modes
1. **Guided Mode** - Maximum hand-holding, step-by-step
2. **Standard Mode** - Balanced guidance
3. **Power User Mode** - Minimal UI, data-dense dashboard
4. **Zen Mode** - No numbers, just visual progress

## Navigation Paradigms
