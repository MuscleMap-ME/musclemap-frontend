5. **Build** - Run `pnpm build:intelligent` to ensure everything compiles
6. **Deploy** - Follow the deployment workflow in CLAUDE.md:
   - Commit changes with message: `fix(auto): Error on /: WebSocket connection to 'wss://musclem`
   - Push to GitHub
   - Deploy via SSH: `ssh -p 2222 root@musclemap.me "cd /var/www/musclemap.me && git pull && pnpm install && pnpm build:intelligent && pm2 restart musclemap"`

### Critical Reminders

- **DO NOT** ask for confirmation - this is fully autonomous
- **DO NOT** skip deployment - the fix must reach production
- **DO** commit with Co-Authored-By: Bug Hunter <bughunter@musclemap.me>
- **DO** verify on production after deployment
- Focus on fixing this specific bug, don't refactor unrelated code
