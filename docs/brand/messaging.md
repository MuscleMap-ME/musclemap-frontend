## Core Identity

### Tagline Options

**Primary (Category-Creating):**
> The Physics of Your Body in Motion

**Alternative A (Outcome-Focused):**
> See Every Muscle. Know Every Rep. Own Your Progress.

**Alternative B (Technology-Forward):**
> The World's First Computational Exercise Physiology Platform

**Alternative C (Personal):**
> Your Biology. Visualized.

**Alternative D (Community):**
> Your Goal. Your Form. Your Tribe.

### One-Liner

> MuscleMap pioneers Computational Exercise Physiology — visualizing every muscle fiber as you train. 100% free. Open source. Community-driven.

### Elevator Pitches

**30 Seconds:**
> MuscleMap is a fitness app that shows you which muscles are actually firing during every exercise — in real-time, with 3D visualization. Unlike apps that just count reps, we use biomechanical modeling to show you the physics of your body in motion. And it's completely free, open source, and built by the community.

**60 Seconds:**
> Traditional fitness apps are blind to your biology. They count reps and track weight, but they have no idea what's happening inside your body. MuscleMap changes that. We've pioneered what we call Computational Exercise Physiology — using biomechanical modeling and machine learning to visualize muscle activation in real-time. You see exactly which muscles are firing, at what intensity, during every exercise. It's the difference between guessing and knowing. And here's the thing: it's 100% free, forever. We're open source, community-driven, and we'll never sell your data. We're building this with NYC as our test city, and we're expanding based on community demand.

**2 Minutes:**
> Let me ask you something. When you do a bench press, do you know exactly which muscles are working? Not just "chest" — I mean, is your pectoralis major firing at 85%? Are your anterior deltoids at 70%? Is your core engaged enough to protect your spine?

> Traditional fitness apps can't tell you this. They count reps. They track weight. They estimate calories. But they're completely blind to what's actually happening in your body.

> That's what we're solving with MuscleMap. We've pioneered a new field called Computational Exercise Physiology — using biomechanical algorithms, EMG research, and machine learning to model muscle activation in real-time. You literally watch your muscles light up on a 3D anatomical model as you train.

> But here's what makes us different: we're 100% free. Not freemium — free. Every feature, every visualization, every algorithm. And we're completely open source. You can audit our code, contribute improvements, or fork it for your own projects.

> We believe fitness science should be accessible to everyone, regardless of income. We're community-driven — users shape our roadmap. We're privacy-first — end-to-end encrypted messaging, local-first data, we can't see your workouts even if we wanted to.

> Right now, we're building and testing in New York City — 8.3 million people with every fitness goal imaginable. Once we've proven it here, we'll expand city by city based on community demand.

> This is the future of fitness: data-driven, visually stunning, community-built, and free for everyone.

## Competitive Positioning

### Versus Strong/Hevy (Rep Trackers)
> They count reps. We show you which muscles are actually firing. It's the difference between logging a workout and understanding it.

### Versus Fitbod (AI Workouts)
> They tell you what to do. We show you why it works — with real-time visualization of muscle activation based on biomechanical modeling.

### Versus Peloton/Apple Fitness+ (Video Content)
> They're video-first. We're data-first. You don't need a trainer on screen when you can see your actual muscles responding.

### Versus All (Open Source)
> Every other fitness app is a black box. We're completely open source — you can audit our algorithms, contribute improvements, or fork the whole thing.

### Versus All (Free)
> Premium features? We don't have those. Every feature is free for everyone. We believe fitness science shouldn't be locked behind paywalls.
