### 2026-01-19: Missing /journey/milestones endpoint (Mobile App)

- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** The mobile app's Journey screen was calling `/journey/milestones` endpoint which did not exist, causing a network error.
- **Root Cause:** The endpoint was never implemented when the mobile journey screen was created.
- **Fix:** Added `/journey/milestones` endpoint to `apps/api/src/http/routes/journeys.ts` that returns milestones from user's active journeys in the format expected by the mobile app.
- **Files Modified:** `apps/api/src/http/routes/journeys.ts`
