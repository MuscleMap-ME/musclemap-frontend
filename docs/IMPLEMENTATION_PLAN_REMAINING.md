| Elite | National/International | 14+ years |

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Create new skill trees per apparatus (4 for WAG, 6 for MAG)
2. Map USAG Code of Points skills to tree nodes
3. Include difficulty values (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
4. Add level requirements for each skill
5. Support both boys/men and girls/women progressions
6. Include skill videos/animations where available

**Database Additions:**
- `apparatus` field on skill trees (vault, bars, beam, floor, pommel, rings, pbars, hbar)

- `difficulty_value` field (A=0.1, B=0.2, ... G=0.7)
- `gender` field on skill trees (male, female, unisex)
- `code_of_points_id` for official USAG skill references

**Estimated Scope:**

## Notes

### What's NOT Needed (Already Exists)
- Military archetypes ✅
- Police/Fire/EMT archetypes ✅
- PT test tracking ✅
- D&D-style stats ✅
- Leaderboards with filters ✅

### Recommendations
1. Start with Phase 1 quick wins to show immediate progress
2. Skill trees will be a major differentiator - prioritize this
3. Martial arts appeals to your target military/first responder users
4. Nutrition/supplements are large undertakings - keep as stubs for now
5. Touchscreen UX can be improved incrementally
