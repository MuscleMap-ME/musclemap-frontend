## Gap Details

### Gap 1: Career Physical Standards

**User problem:** Firefighters, military, law enforcement, and other professionals have specific physical tests they must pass for employment and ongoing certification. No fitness app helps them train specifically for these standards.

**Current state:** MuscleMap has PT tests routes but lacks comprehensive standards data, readiness tracking, and standard-aware training prescription.

**Proposed solution:** "Career Readiness" module with:
- Standards database (CPAT, ACFT, PFT, POST, etc.)
- Per-event tracking and assessment logging
- Readiness score calculation
- Standard-aware prescription generation
- Unit readiness dashboards for supervisors

**Why it's original:** No fitness app addresses career physical standards. This is greenfield territory.

**MuscleMap advantage:**
- Prescription engine can target weak events
- Muscle activation data identifies physical gaps
- Hangouts align with real workplaces (stations, units)

---

### Gap 2: Activity/Field Recording

**User problem:** Users want to record outdoor activities (runs, rucks, swims) with GPS and timing, but current MuscleMap only tracks strength workouts.

**Current state:** No GPS activity recording. Workout logging is strength-focused.

**Proposed solution:** "Field Log" module with:
- GPS-based activity recording
- Job-specific activity types (ruck march, swim, rope climb)
- Offline recording for areas without connectivity
- Delayed posting for OPSEC

**Why it's original:** Unlike Strava (cycling/running focus), Field Log emphasizes:
- Tactical activities (ruck, swim, climb)
- Load-bearing (PPE, ruck weight)
- Shift-aware scheduling
- OPSEC-friendly defaults

**MuscleMap advantage:**
- Integrates with strength data for total load
- PPE/equipment weight considerations
- Privacy-first for sensitive users

---

### Gap 3: Safety/Emergency Features

**User problem:** Users training alone in remote areas or dangerous conditions need safety features - location sharing with trusted contacts, emergency alerts, and heat/condition warnings.

**Current state:** No safety features. No location sharing, no emergency alerts.

**Proposed solution:**
- "Lifeline" - real-time location sharing with trusted contacts
- "Mayday" - emergency alert system
- "Safe Zones" - auto-hide sensitive locations
- "Conditions Alert" - weather + PPE load warnings

**Why it's original:** Names avoid Strava's "Beacon" trademark. Features are OPSEC-aware for military/law enforcement users.

**MuscleMap advantage:**
- Crew-based notifications (alert my partner, not random contacts)
- PPE-aware heat warnings (vest + humidity = danger)
- OPSEC defaults for sensitive users

---

### Gap 4: Offline Mode

**User problem:** Firefighters in wildfires, military in the field, and users in remote areas have no cell service. They need to log workouts and activities offline.

**Current state:** Requires internet connection for all features.

**Proposed solution:** "Offline Mode" with:
- Local-first data storage
- Background sync when connected
- Conflict resolution for multi-device

**Why it's original:** Most fitness apps assume connectivity. MuscleMap serves users who operate in austere environments.

**MuscleMap advantage:**
- Critical for tactical professionals
- Sync-when-available model
- Handles multi-day disconnection

---

### Gap 5: Device Integrations

**User problem:** Users want their wearable data (heart rate, steps, sleep) to flow into MuscleMap automatically.

**Current state:** Wearables service exists but limited provider support.

**Proposed solution:** Expand wearable integrations:
- Garmin Connect API
- Apple HealthKit
- Google Fit
- Wahoo
- Whoop

**Why it's original:** Integration focuses on strength + cardio unification, not just cardio.

**MuscleMap advantage:**
- Correlate biometrics with muscle activation
- Recovery modeling from sleep + HRV data
- Unified training load (strength + cardio)

---

### Gap 6: Analytics & Periodization

**User problem:** Users want to understand their training trends, plan training phases, and know when to rest.

**Current state:** Basic stats exist but no trend analysis, periodization planning, or recovery modeling.

**Proposed solution:**
- "Training Intel" - trend dashboards
- "Battle Rhythm" - periodization planning (shift-aware)
- "Recovery Status" - fatigue modeling
- "Load Index" - training load calculation

**Why it's original:** "Battle Rhythm" is shift-aware for 24-hour shift workers (firefighters, nurses, etc.).

**MuscleMap advantage:**
- Muscle-based fatigue (not just HR)
- Shift-aware scheduling
- Force-velocity based load calculation

---

### Gap 7: Data Export & Ownership

**User problem:** Users want to own their data, export it for backup, and be GDPR compliant.

**Current state:** No data export functionality.

**Proposed solution:** "Data Vault" with:
- Full data export (JSON, CSV)
- GDPR compliance (right to erasure)
- Data portability

**Why it's original:** Standard compliance feature but necessary for trust.

**MuscleMap advantage:**
- Muscle activation data export (unique data type)
- Career readiness history export

---

### Gap 8: Leaderboard Integrity

**User problem:** Users want fair competition. Cheaters degrade the experience.

**Current state:** Basic anticheat exists but limited anomaly detection, no audit trail, no appeal process.

**Proposed solution:** Enhance integrity features:
- Physiology-based anomaly detection
- Biomechanics bounds checking
- Verified device status
- Audit trail for disputed results
- Appeal process

**Why it's original:** Detection uses physiology (muscle activation patterns) not just statistics.

**MuscleMap advantage:**
- Muscle activation anomalies (impossible patterns)
- Biomechanics limits (human performance bounds)
- Wearable signature verification

---

### Gap 9: Team Readiness Dashboards

**User problem:** Supervisors (fire captains, platoon sergeants, SWAT commanders) need to know if their unit is physically ready for duty.

**Current state:** No supervisor/commander view of team fitness.

**Proposed solution:** "Unit Readiness" dashboard with:
- Team member readiness percentages
- Aggregate readiness (X of Y members ready)
- Weak area identification
- Trend tracking

**Why it's original:** No fitness app provides supervisor visibility into team fitness.

**MuscleMap advantage:**
- Integrates with Hangouts (unit = hangout)
- Career standards alignment
- Opt-in privacy (members consent to visibility)

---
