# Why MuscleMap is Open Source

> **Fitness science should be accessible to everyone.** No paywalls. No premium tiers. No locked features. Just a global community building the future of exercise together.

---

## Our Philosophy

### Free Forever

MuscleMap is **100% free**. Not freemium. Not "free with ads." Not "free trial." Completely, permanently, unconditionally free.

Every feature. Every visualization. Every insight. Every algorithm.

**Why?** Because we believe:

1. **Fitness shouldn't be a privilege** — Everyone deserves access to the best tools
2. **Science should be shared** — Hoarding knowledge helps no one
3. **Community beats corporation** — Together, we build something better
4. **Transparency builds trust** — You should see how your data is used

### Open Source

Our entire codebase is public on GitHub:

**https://github.com/jeanpaulniko/musclemap**

This means:

- **Audit our code** — Verify our privacy claims yourself
- **Contribute improvements** — Make MuscleMap better for everyone
- **Fork and experiment** — Build on our foundation
- **Learn from our approach** — Use our patterns in your projects

### Community-Driven

MuscleMap isn't built by a faceless corporation. It's built by **fitness enthusiasts, for fitness enthusiasts**.

- Users shape the roadmap
- Community members moderate the platform
- Feature requests come from real needs
- Bug fixes happen in days, not quarters

## Governance

### How Decisions Get Made

MuscleMap uses a transparent governance model:

**Feature Requests:**
1. Proposed in GitHub Issues or Slack `#feature-requests`
2. Community discussion and upvoting
3. Maintainers prioritize based on impact and feasibility
4. Implementation by contributors or core team

**Technical Architecture:**
1. Discussed in GitHub Discussions
2. RFC (Request for Comments) for major changes
3. Community feedback period
4. Maintainer decision with public rationale

**Bug Priorities:**
- Critical (security, data loss): Immediate
- High (broken features): Days
- Medium (annoyances): Weeks
- Low (nice-to-have): Backlog

### Core Principles

1. **Transparency** — All decisions discussed openly
2. **Meritocracy** — Good ideas win, regardless of source
3. **Inclusivity** — Everyone's fitness journey matters
4. **Science-first** — Evidence over opinion
5. **User privacy** — Your data is yours

## Sustainability

**"If it's free, how do you survive?"**

Great question. Here's our model:

1. **Donations** — Optional support from grateful users
2. **Enterprise features** — Team management for gyms/coaches (still open source)
3. **Partnerships** — Equipment manufacturers, gym chains
4. **Grants** — Open source and health tech funding

We'll never:
- Sell your data
- Lock features behind paywalls
- Show you ads
- Compromise on privacy
