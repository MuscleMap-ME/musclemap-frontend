# MuscleMap NYC

> **Built and tested in New York City** — the world's toughest fitness market and the perfect proving ground.

---

## Why NYC?

MuscleMap is being developed in New York City because NYC is the ultimate stress test for a fitness platform:

### Diversity at Scale

**8.3 million people** with every fitness goal imaginable:
- Marathon runners training for NYC Marathon
- Bodybuilders prepping for shows
- CrossFitters competing at the Games
- Dancers maintaining performance
- First responders staying job-ready
- Office workers fighting sedentary life
- Seniors maintaining mobility
- Kids building healthy habits

If MuscleMap works for NYC's diversity, it works for everyone.

### Extreme Conditions

NYC weather tests everything:
- **Brutal summers** — 95°F with humidity
- **Harsh winters** — Snow, ice, and 10°F days
- **Unpredictable transitions** — 40-degree swings in a day

Our adaptive features handle it all:
- Indoor alternatives when outdoor isn't feasible
- Weather-aware workout suggestions
- Seasonal program adjustments

### 24/7 Culture

New Yorkers work out at every hour:
- 5 AM before the trading floor opens
- Lunch workouts squeezed into 45 minutes
- Midnight sessions after restaurant shifts
- Weekend warriors going hard

MuscleMap supports all schedules.

### Transit-Dependent Living

Most New Yorkers don't have cars:
- Bodyweight workouts for park sessions
- Equipment-adaptive programming
- Gym-hopping friendly (no single gym assumption)
- Home workout fallbacks

### Fitness Industry Epicenter

NYC has it all:
- **Boutique studios** — SoulCycle, Barry's, Tone House
- **Mega-chains** — Equinox, NYSC, Planet Fitness
- **Independent gyms** — Legendary spots with character
- **Outdoor spaces** — Central Park, Hudson River, Brooklyn Bridge Park
- **Specialty facilities** — Climbing, martial arts, dance, swimming
