## Choosing Your Archetype

Your archetype defines your training philosophy. It doesn't limit what exercises you can do - it guides your progression and connects you with like-minded trainers.

### The 10 Archetypes

| Archetype | Focus | Best For |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Spartan** | Raw strength, endurance | Those who want functional power |
| **Athlete** | Balanced performance | Sports and overall fitness |
| **Dancer** | Grace, flexibility | Mobility and body control |
| **Monk** | Mind-body connection | Meditation and focused training |
| **Warrior** | Combat readiness | Martial artists, fighters |
| **Explorer** | Functional fitness | Outdoor adventurers |
| **Guardian** | Protective strength | Those protecting others |
| **Scholar** | Scientific optimization | Data-driven trainers |
| **Healer** | Recovery and longevity | Long-term health focus |
| **Artisan** | Crafted aesthetics | Physique-focused training |

### How to Choose

Ask yourself:
- What body do I admire?
- What activities do I want to excel at?
- What mindset resonates with me?

**Don't worry** - you can change your archetype later, and your progress carries over!

## Your First Workout

### Starting a Workout

1. **From the Dashboard**, tap "Start Workout"
2. **Choose workout type**:
   - **Quick Start** - Log exercises as you go
   - **Prescription** - AI-generated workout for your goals
   - **Custom Template** - Your saved workout routines

### Logging Exercises

For each exercise, enter:
- **Sets** - Number of rounds
- **Reps** - Repetitions per set
- **Weight** - Load used (optional)
- **Duration** - Time-based exercises (optional)
- **Notes** - Any comments (optional)

### The Muscle Map

As you log exercises, watch the muscle visualization update in real-time:

```
Muscle Activation Display:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     🔴 = High activation (>70%) │
│     🟠 = Medium (40-70%)        │
│     🟡 = Low (20-40%)           │
│     ⚪ = Minimal (<20%)         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Training Units (TU)

Every workout earns **Training Units** - our normalized metric that:
- Accounts for muscle size and importance
- Normalizes different exercise types
- Gives you comparable progress over time

```
Example TU Calculation:
├── Bench Press: 3x10 @ 135lbs
│   └── Chest (40%), Triceps (30%), Shoulders (30%)
│   └── TU earned: 45
├── Squats: 4x8 @ 185lbs
│   └── Quads (50%), Glutes (30%), Hamstrings (20%)
│   └── TU earned: 72
└── Total Session: 117 TU
```
