## 🎮 How The Complete System Works

### 1. **User Onboarding**
```
User selects archetype → Starts at Level 1 → 0/100 TU
```

### 2. **Weekly Training**
```
User follows prescribed exercises
Each exercise calculates TUs based on:
  - Muscle activations
  - Sets × Reps × Intensity
  - Bias weight normalization
```

### 3. **Progress Tracking**
```
3D muscle model lights up (normalized display)
Progress bars show TU completion per muscle group
Weekly goal: Complete 100 TU
```

### 4. **Level Progression**
```
100 TU achieved → Level unlocked
User advances to Level 2, then Level 3
Each level increases difficulty/complexity
```

### 5. **Archetype Switching** (Optional)
```
Users can switch archetypes
Progress resets to Level 1 of new archetype
Provides variety and prevents plateaus
```

## 💡 Key Differentiators

### 1. **Complete Normalization**
Every muscle's capacity is accounted for:
- Glutes (β=4.2): Need 63 sets/week to "fill"
- Rear Delts (β=0.7): Need 10.5 sets/week to "fill"
- Rotator Cuff (β=0.4): Need 6 sets/week to "fill"

**Result:** Small muscles show meaningful progress, large muscles don't dominate

### 2. **100 TU Goal System**
- Clear, concrete targets
- Gamification through achievement
- Works across all archetypes
- Credit system integrates seamlessly (25 credits per workout)

### 3. **Scientific Foundation**
- All bias weights from peer-reviewed research
- Exercise activations from EMG studies
- Progression principles from meta-analyses
- Every number is defensible

### 4. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- 10 distinct training philosophies
- 30 progression paths
- 3,000 TU of content
- Something for everyone

## 💰 Monetization Integration

### Credit System
```
Standard workout: 25 credits = $0.25
Power user: 10 workouts/month = $2.50/month
High frequency: 20 workouts/month = $5.00/month
```

### User Psychology
- Small per-workout cost removes price resistance
- Skin in the game increases commitment
- Variable spending matches usage
- No subscription fatigue

### Revenue Projections
```
50K users, $2.50 avg ARPU = $1.5M annual
100K users, $3.00 avg ARPU = $3.6M annual (Year 2)
Focused users: $42 LTV (85% retention)
LTV:CAC ratio: 9.5× (excellent unit economics)
```
