# MuscleMap - Executive Summary

## The Problem: Fitness Apps Have an 80% Churn Rate

Users log sets into spreadsheets and hope something's working. There's no feedback loop, no visual proof, no moment of "I can see my progress."

**Result**: People give up because progress is invisible.

---

## The Solution: MuscleMap

A fitness visualization platform that renders real-time muscle activation on a 3D anatomical model. Log a set, watch the muscle light up. Complete your weekly goal, see your entire body glow.

**It transforms abstract workout data into immediate, visceral feedback.**

---

## The Innovation: Proprietary Bias Weight System

At the core is a bias weight system that normalizes activation display across 98+ muscles:
- Your glutes need 20 sets to "fill up"
- Your rear delts need 6
- **The system knows. It shows balanced, accurate progress.**

This is something no other app does. It's your competitive moat.

---

## The Platform

**Completely cross-platform:**
- iOS, Android, Apple Watch
- Web, desktop
- Future: Garmin, Whoop, Fitbit, Apple Vision Pro

**Built on:**
- React Native + Three.js
- Shared TypeScript core
- Real-time wearable sync ready

## The Market

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- 184M fitness app users globally
- $6.86B fitness app market (2024)
- Growing 17.6% annually

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
- 50M serious fitness enthusiasts
- Willing to pay for premium features
- $2.5B opportunity

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- 100K users (Year 1)
- 500K users (Year 3)

---

## The Business Model

### Revenue: Per-Workout Pricing
- **25 credits per workout** = $0.25
- Average user: 10 workouts/month = $2.50
- Power user: 20 workouts/month = $5.00

**Why this works:**
- Removes price resistance (micro-transaction)
- Variable pricing matches usage
- No unused subscription guilt
- Credits never expire

### Unit Economics
- **LTV**: $42 (18-month lifetime, 85% retention)
- **CAC**: $4.50 (organic + paid social)
- **LTV:CAC**: 9.3× (excellent)

### Revenue Projections
- **Year 1**: 100K users → $3.6M ARR
- **Year 2**: 300K users → $10.8M ARR
- **Year 3**: 500K users → $18M ARR

---

## The Competition

### Current Players
**Strong, JEFIT, Hevy**
- Focus on tracking only
- No visualization
- No prescriptive guidance
- Generic approach

**Fitbod, Boostcamp**
- AI recommendations
- Still tracking-first
- No muscle visualization
- No scientific normalization

### MuscleMap's Advantage
✅ **Only app** with 3D muscle visualization  
✅ **Only app** with bias-weighted normalization  
✅ **Only app** with Training Unit system  
✅ **Only app** with 10 distinct training philosophies  

**Our moat**: The bias weight system is proprietary and requires deep anatomical knowledge to replicate.

## The Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: User Acquisition Cost
**Mitigation**: Organic growth via differentiation + community

### Risk 2: Wearable Integration Delays
**Mitigation**: Web app works standalone, wearables are upside

### Risk 3: Larger Competitor Copies Us
**Mitigation**: Bias weight IP, first-mover advantage, community moat

### Risk 4: Technical Complexity of 3D
**Mitigation**: Three.js mature, team has expertise, MVP works without 3D
