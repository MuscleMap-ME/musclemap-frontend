# MuscleMap Documentation

Welcome to MuscleMap - the fitness platform that visualizes every muscle you train and connects you with a community that shares your goals.

## What is MuscleMap?

MuscleMap is a **cross-platform fitness application** that transforms how you track workouts. Unlike traditional fitness apps that just count reps, MuscleMap shows you exactly which muscles are firing during every exercise - in real-time, with beautiful 3D visualizations.

### Our Philosophy

> **Your Goal. Your Form. Your Tribe.**

Whether you want to build a Spartan physique, lose weight, train for a marathon, or just feel healthier - MuscleMap adapts to YOU. Choose your archetype, track your progress visually, and find others on the same journey.
